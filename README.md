## Project Credits

**Project by:** RhinocerosPants Team - Aaron Young  
**Development:** With assistance from Anthropic's Claude Code  
**Repository:** https://github.com/RhinocerosPants/ESP32_MinimaSlidrAutomat  
**Version:** 2.0 - Production Release

A fully autonomous ESP32 camera slider with dual hall effect sensors that automatically measures travel distance and runs continuous ping-pong motion without any user configuration.

## Overview

MinimaSlidrAutomat is designed for simplicity and self-calibration. Upon power-up, it:
1. Automatically finds Home A sensor (left end)
2. Moves to find Home B sensor (right end) 
3. Measures actual travel distance between sensors
4. Calculates optimal ping-pong range automatically
5. Moves to start position with a 3-second pause
6. Begins continuous ping-pong motion within measured range
7. Runs indefinitely until power is removed

## Operation Sequence

### 1. Power-On Boot
- Initializes hardware (stepper, dual hall sensors, serial)
- Enables motor driver
- Begins automatic dual sensor homing sequence

### 2. Home A Homing Phase
- **Speed**: 100mm/s (constant speed, no acceleration) 
- **Direction**: Moves left (negative) to find Home A sensor
- **Detection**: Stops immediately when Home A sensor activates
- **Timeout**: 40 seconds maximum (1000mm safe travel limit)
- **Completion**: Sets Home A sensor position as 0mm reference
- **LED Status**: Breathing amber animation during homing

### 3. Home B Homing Phase  
- **Speed**: 100mm/s (constant speed, no acceleration)
- **Direction**: Moves right (positive) to find Home B sensor
- **Detection**: Stops immediately when Home B sensor activates
- **Timeout**: 40 seconds maximum (1000mm safe travel limit)
- **Measurement**: Records actual travel distance between sensors
- **LED Status**: Continues breathing amber animation

### 4. Travel Range Calculation
- **Measurement**: Calculates actual distance between Home A and Home B
- **Range Calculation**: Determines safe ping-pong limits with sensor clearance
- **Safety Check**: Validates minimum 100mm travel range available
- **Configuration**: Sets pingPongStartMM and pingPongEndMM automatically

### 5. Start Pause
- **Duration**: 3 seconds
- **Purpose**: Time to prepare camera/recording equipment  
- **Position**: Pauses at Home B end (travel end position)
- **Status**: Reports "PAUSING_AT_START" state

### 6. Ping-Pong Motion
- **Range**: Calculated automatically based on measured travel distance
- **Example**: If 500mm travel measured, ping-pong from 20mm to 445mm (425mm range)
- **Speed**: 17.3mm/s maximum speed
- **Acceleration**: 4-second smooth acceleration/deceleration
- **Pattern**: Continuous back-and-forth motion within calculated safe limits
- **Duration**: Infinite (until power removed)
- **LED Status**: Green ping-pong animation following motion direction

```

## Safety Features

### Crash Detection
- **Dual Sensor Monitoring**: Monitors both Home A and Home B sensors during operation
- **Home A Trigger**: Sensor activation when position > sensor clearance (20mm)
- **Home B Trigger**: Sensor activation when position < (measured travel - clearance)
- **Response**: Immediate emergency stop, **motor holds position**
- **Recovery**: Power cycle required
- **Purpose**: Detects mechanical collisions, belt slippage, or sensor interference
- **Safety**: Motor maintains holding torque to prevent sliding on inclines

### Position Bounds Checking  
- **Dynamic Range**: -50mm to (measured travel + 50mm) safety bounds
- **Example**: If 500mm travel measured, bounds are -50mm to 550mm
- **Response**: Emergency stop, **motor holds position**
- **Purpose**: Prevents runaway motion beyond physically possible limits
- **Safety**: Motor maintains holding torque to prevent sliding on inclines

### Homing Timeout
- **Duration**: 40 seconds maximum
- **Purpose**: Prevents infinite homing if sensor fails
- **Response**: Error state, **motor holds position**

### Acceleration Distance Compensation
- **Margin**: 35mm buffer for acceleration/deceleration
- **Purpose**: Prevents overrun due to motion physics
- **Implementation**: Reduced end position from 550mm to 515mm

### Incline Safety System
- **Problem**: On inclined setups, motor disable would cause uncontrolled sliding
- **Solution**: Motor maintains holding torque during error states
- **Benefit**: Protects expensive camera equipment from crashes
- **Operation**: stepper.stop() called but motor stays enabled
- **Recovery**: Power cycle required to restart from safe state

## LED Status Indicators

MinimaSlidrAutomat features a 5-LED WS2812B strip providing visual status indication:

### LED States
- **ðŸŸ  Breathing Amber**: Homing phase - searching for hall sensor
- **ðŸŸ¢ Green Ping-Pong**: Normal operation - LED moves back and forth following slider motion  
- **ðŸ”´ Breathing Red**: Error state - crash detected, timeout, or bounds exceeded

### LED Behaviors
- **Breathing Effect**: Smooth fade in/out animation (30ms updates)
- **Ping-Pong Effect**: Single LED moves left-right with trailing dim LED (150ms updates)
- **Test Pattern**: Blue sequence flash on startup to verify LEDs working

### Hardware
- **LEDs**: 5x WS2812B addressable RGB LEDs
- **Connection**: Data pin 23, 5V power, GND
- **Brightness**: 25% default (64/255) for comfortable viewing
- **Protocol**: FastLED library with GRB color order

## Calibration Process

The current values were calibrated using laser measurement:

### Steps-per-MM Calibration
1. **Commanded distance**: 520mm ping-pong range
2. **Laser measured**: 559mm actual movement
3. **Calculation**: 43.01 Ã— (559 Ã· 520) = 46.24 steps/mm
4. **Result**: Position reporting now matches actual movement

### Travel Distance Verification
- **Physical rail**: ~639mm maximum travel
- **Software limit**: 580mm (conservative safety margin)
- **Ping-pong range**: 485mm usable travel
- **Acceleration margin**: 35mm buffer for smooth motion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**System won't home**
- Check dual hall sensor connections (Pin 21 for Home A, Pin 22 for Home B, GND, 3.3V)
- Verify sensor polarity (active low with pullup)
- Ensure Home A sensor is positioned at left end and Home B sensor at right end of travel
- Check 40-second timeout hasn't expired for each sensor

**Motor doesn't move**
- Verify TMC2208 connections (STEP=Pin2, DIR=Pin4, EN=Pin5)
- Check 12V motor power supply
- Ensure motor coils properly connected
- Test Enable pin (should be LOW when running)

**Overruns end of travel**
- Check steps-per-mm calibration (currently 46.24)
- Verify acceleration distance compensation (35mm margin)
- Reduce PING_PONG_END value if necessary
- Check for mechanical binding or belt stretch

**Crashes detected falsely**
- Verify hall sensor isn't triggered by magnetic interference
- Check sensor mounting - should only activate at home position
- Adjust crash detection threshold (currently 30mm)

**Jerky or harsh motion**
- Increase ACCELERATION value for gentler motion (currently 200)
- Check power supply stability under load
- Verify stepper motor current settings
- Test with lower MAX_SPEED

### Error Recovery
Most errors require **power cycle** to reset:
1. **Motor will hold position** during error state (safe for inclines)
2. Power off ESP32 completely
3. Check and fix underlying issue
4. Power on - system will restart from beginning
5. **Note**: Motor maintains holding torque until power cycle for safety

## Customization

### Adjusting Motion Parameters

**Speed Changes:**
```cpp
#define MAX_SPEED 600    // Slower: 13mm/s instead of 17.3mm/s  
#define MAX_SPEED 1000   // Faster: 21.6mm/s instead of 17.3mm/s
```

**Acceleration Changes:**
```cpp
#define ACCELERATION 100  // Gentler: 8-second accel/decel
#define ACCELERATION 400  // Sharper: 2-second accel/decel  
```

**Travel Range Changes:**
```cpp
#define PING_PONG_START 20.0f   // Closer to sensor
#define PING_PONG_END   520.0f  // Longer travel (check overrun!)
```

**Pause Duration:**
```cpp
#define START_PAUSE_MS 5000  // 5-second pause instead of 3
#define START_PAUSE_MS 1000  // 1-second pause instead of 3
```

### Re-calibration Process

If mechanical changes are made:

1. **Measure actual travel** with laser/ruler during ping-pong
2. **Calculate new steps-per-mm**:
   ```
   New = Current Ã— (Commanded Ã· Actual)
   ```
3. **Update STEPS_PER_MM** in code
4. **Verify no overruns** occur
5. **Test crash detection** still works

## Dependencies

#include <AccelStepper.h>  // Stepper motor control with acceleration
#include <FastLED.h>       // WS2812B LED strip control
